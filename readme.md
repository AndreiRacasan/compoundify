# Compoundify

If you invest Â£10,000 today at an average interest rate of 7% over the next 15 years, how much money will you earn? Compoundify helps you find this out.

Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4... and a bit of math. A good way to exercise DOM manipulation, JS's date methods and ES6's currency formatter.
